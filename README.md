<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://nascent-bot-cancer-app-myappwelcome-i66wjm.streamlitapp.com)

A **Convolutional Neural Network**, also known as CNN or ConvNet, is a class of [neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks) that specializes in processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as an image. The benefits of deep learning in healthcare are plentiful – fast, efficient, accurate – but they don’t stop there. Even more benefits lie within the neural networks formed by multiple layers of `AI` and `ML` and their ability to learn. With the help of these great technologies, I have created a model that could **predict whether a person is malignant with Breast Cancer or not**.
> [Breast cancer](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3986-breast-cancer) is an uncontrolled growth of breast cells.  


Why Breast Cancer is Dangerous ☢️:
* 1 in 8 women who live to be age 70 will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.
* Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women in Ireland.
* In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths globally [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/breast-cancer)
* In 2022, it is estimated that 43,250 women and 530
men will die of breast cancer. [ACS](https://www.cancer.org/)

But there is good news:
* Breast Cancer's mortality rate has been **declining since 1989**
* Women whose breast cancer is detected at an early stage have a **93 percent or higher survival rate**

Based on the experimental results, the proposed model achieved 91.5% accuracy

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Clone the Repo.
  ```sh 
git clone https://github.com/ACM40960/project-Sukesh-Perla.git
  ```
  

#### Installation

Below is the list of applications that are needed to be installed to view and execute this project locally.

Frameworks
1. Anaconda ([Steps to Install](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/installing-anaconda-windows)) ⚠️select python version above 3.5
2. Atom ([Steps to Install](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-setup-atom-editor-with-all-the-required-packages/)) 

#### Packages  
Launch the terminal by following the below steps 
1. Execute Anaconda Navigator
2. Click on Environments
3. Create an Environment
4. Select created environment -> Open Terminal

Now you are good to install the required packages using console. Use the below commands to install them in your environment.

To Execute  the Model
```sh 
conda install numpy
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install pandas
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install matplotlib
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install seaborn
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install scikit-learn
  ```
  ```sh 
pip install pytest-shutil
  ```
  ```sh 
pip3 install opencv-python
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install tensorflow
```
To Render with UI
```sh
pip install streamlit
 ```
```sh
pip install pybase64
 ```
```sh
pip install datetime
  ```
  ```sh 
  pip install Pillow
  ```

### Execution
To Train The Model 
```diff
- ⚠️ It took approximately 4hrs to train all the images.
```
1. Open Anaconda Navigator
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook Note: Please Install if require
3. Upload [Model.ipynb](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-Sukesh-Perla/blob/main/Model.ipynb)
4. Press Shift+Enter to run cells one by one (Details instruction is also provided in the notebook itself)
More information about the model are given in the file

To View as Web Application
1. Launch Anaconda terminal as mentioned  <a href="#packages">here</a>
2. Navigate to the location were the project is cloned using cd command
3. Make sure `Welcome.py` file is located and file structure is maintained

```markdown
├── src
    |
    ├── MyApp
    │   ├── Welcome.py
    │   ├── Pages
    │   |   ├── How_To_Use.py
    │   |   ├── Predict.py
    │   ├── Data
    │   |   ├── data.csv
    │   ├── Best Model
    ├── Images
    ├── Model.ipynb
    ├── README.md
```

4. Now use below command to host the application locally
```sh 
  streamlit run Welcome.py
  ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once the webpage is launched click on the [Predict](https://nascent-bot-cancer-app-myappwelcome-i66wjm.streamlitapp.com/Predict) tab
* Step 1: Fill the User Information (Not Mandatory)
* Step 2: Upload The Image
	* Step 2.1: Browse File to upload the histopathology image
	* Step 2.2: You can also use sample image from drop down list if you don't have any histopathology image for testing.
* Step 3: Click "Run On This Image"
* Step 4: Please Wait, Result with useful information will be displayed
